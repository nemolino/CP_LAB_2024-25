## ex. 01 - ***string_distance*** 

Write a program that takes in input from the user a string $x$ that :

- has length between 3 and 10

- contains only alphabetical characters ( ab...z AB...Z )

If $x$ does not meet these requirements, ask the user another string until they are met.

Once you have a valid $x$, read the words contained in the file ***words.txt*** and find the word that has the minimum distance from $x$.

The words in the file contains non-alphabetical characters, remove them from the words before computing the distances.

For example if you read the word "(ins8ura[nCe" you can consider it as "insuranCe".

Distance between two words $w_1$ and $w_2$ :

- equals $\text{âˆž} $, if length of $w_1 \neq$ length of $w_2$

- is the sum of the distance between string characters with the same index, otherwise

    - dist ( a , a ) = 0
    - dist ( a , b ) = 1
    - ...
    - dist ( a , z ) = 25
    - distance between characters is not case-sensitive : 
        - dist ( a , c ) = dist ( A , C ) = dist ( A , c ) = dist ( a , C ) = 2

For example 

dist ( "ciao" , "caio" ) = dist ( c , c ) + dist ( i , a ) + dist ( a, i ) + dist ( o , o ) = 0 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 16
