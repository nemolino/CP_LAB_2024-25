## ex. 01 - ***string_distance*** 

Write a program that takes in input from the user a string $x$ that :

- has length between 3 and 10

- contains only alphabetical characters ( ab...z AB...Z )

If $x$ does not meet these requirements, ask the user another string until they are met.

Once you have a valid $x$, read the words contained in the file ***words.txt*** and find the word that has the minimum distance from $x$.

The words in the file also contain some non-alphabetical characters, remove them from the words before computing the distances.

For example, if you read the word "(ins8ura[nCe" in the distance calculation you can consider it as "insuranCe".

Distance between two characters is the distance they have on the "alphabet line"

- dist ( a , a ) = 0
- dist ( a , b ) = 1
- ...
- dist ( a , z ) = 25
- it is not case-sensitive : 
    - dist ( a , c ) = dist ( A , C ) = dist ( A , c ) = dist ( a , C ) = 2

Distance between two words $w_1$ and $w_2$ :

- equals $\text{âˆž} $, if length of $w_1 \neq$ length of $w_2$

- is the sum of the distance between their characters with the same index, otherwise

For example :

dist ( "ciao" , "caio" ) = dist ( c , c ) + dist ( i , a ) + dist ( a , i ) + dist ( o , o ) = 0 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 16 


### execution examples :

```
Insert a string : ciao123
The string 'ciao123' is invalid
Insert a string : Ciaone 
Lowest distance from 'Ciaone' is 11
and it is given by the word 'chaRGe'
```

```
Insert a string : insurance
Lowest distance from 'insurance' is 0
and it is given by the word '(ins8ura[nCe'
```

```
Insert a string : abcdefghijk
The string 'abcdefghijk' is invalid
Insert a string : abcdefghij 
Lowest distance from 'abcdefghij' is 50
and it is given by the word 'engage2menT'
```
